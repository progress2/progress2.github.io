<h1>Astride Toh </h1>
<p> I am a sophomore who is discovering the world everyday.One aspect of the world I discover this year is the growth and importance of technology.When I joined the Girls Who Code club at my school I thought coding will be easy and that there isn't much to it.I thought it will just be a fun way to past time with my friends. Yet once I started to take the class and attend hackatons I soon realized how complicate and influencial the world of computer science is.Therefore this summer I'm taking the time to learn how to code so I can impact the world.Not to forget that coding is also beneficial to me as I'll be more tech savvy and knowledgable about the internet and the tech behind it. .!</p>

<p> love to read and listen to music. Reading bring me in another world and makes me feels emotions that tv can't. Through reading I became another person aware of social issues and I enjoy having a conscious in this world.Music on the other hand is like a book but with beats. I like music in which artists challenge the media and dare be different.I like upbeat songs, slow tempo songs, rap songs and just about anything that give me emotions and share a message to me.!</p>
